## Project Overview
An interactive dashboard built with Python and Streamlit for analyzing employee attendance patterns. This project demonstrates data cleaning, analysis, and visualization of employee attendance data using various Python libraries.

## Features
- Interactive dashboard with real-time filtering capabilities
- Multiple visualization types for attendance patterns
- Department-wise and location-wise analysis
- Attendance trends over time
- Detailed employee-wise attendance metrics
- Export capabilities for further analysis

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.11
- Streamlit (Interactive Dashboard)
- Pandas (Data Processing)
- Plotly (Interactive Visualizations)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
- pytest (Testing)
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
